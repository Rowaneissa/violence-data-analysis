# 🧠 Violence Justification Analysis

This project analyzes public attitudes toward the justification of violence against women and girls using demographic factors like **gender**, **residence area**, and **education level**.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Dataset:** [Violence Against Women & Girls - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/violence-against-women-girls)
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Key Techniques:** Data cleaning, groupby aggregation, visual storytelling, demographic comparison

---

## 🧪 Process

1. Cleaned and filtered the dataset (handled missing values)
2. Used `groupby()` to analyze average agreement levels
3. Focused on 3 key demographic dimensions:
   - Gender
   - Area (Urban vs Rural)
   - Education Level
4. Visualized results using barplots

---

## 📈 Key Findings

### 🎯 Gender Differences
- Males showed a higher average agreement with justifying violence compared to females.

### 🏡 Urban vs Rural
- Rural populations showed slightly higher tolerance toward violence.

### 🎓 Education Impact
- Agreement with violence justification **decreases** as the level of education increases.
  - "No education" had the highest average agreement.
  - "Higher education" had the lowest.

## 💡 Conclusions

- Education is a strong negative predictor of violence justification.
- Awareness campaigns should be more targeted toward rural and less-educated populations.
- Gender-based interventions can help reduce societal acceptance of violence.
